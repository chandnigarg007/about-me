            <h4>Often confused looks</h4>
        </p>
        <div>
            <em>Industrial and rustic</em>
        </div>
        Every industrial look is rustic but not every rustic look is industrial.
        <div><em>Eclectic and modern</em></div>
        Every eclectic look is modern but not every modern look is eclectic.
        <div><em>Victorian and shabby chic</em></div>
        Shabby chic is a more feminine version of victorian. Think of it like this- the difference between the two is that of a teenager and an adult, both who adore glamour and luxury. The teenager princess will desire for a more girly and sensational look whereas the adult will long for class and royalty, a little more mature rather than sensible.
        <div><em>Modern and minimalist</em></div>
        Modern is more stylized and has a classier look. It may have less clutter but that look has a purpose - when there are minimal amounts of furniture, it is a look created in the room, whereas in a minimalistic scheme, it serves as a function rather than a statement.
